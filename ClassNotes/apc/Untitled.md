The group consisted of Thomas Rice and I. The Github repository can be found [here.](https://github.com/fahnestockj/ELEC3225Assignment2) It was managed using branching, PRs, and commits. 

### Received Comments
Most of Tom's comments were focused on grammar. He mostly worked on how the repository was managed, setting up branches and pull requests. 

### Given Comments
I offered some suggestions on extra topics to add in Tom's process models. For integration and configuration I suggested bringing up a package manager to install some of the packages. For the incremental model I suggested talking about managing multiple versions using git branching.


### Chosen Process Model
The process model I chose was the incremental model. A majority of roadblocks in software can't be predicted by our monkey brains. This is a tricky thing to communicate to users and customers especially when outlining a timeline for software to be built. The incremental model leaves space for priorities and acceptance criteria to be shifted to what can be reasonably accomplished while still pushing the team to meet the deadline. This added flexibility allows for adaptability which lets the team work incrementally on their own working habits while working incrementally on the project.
