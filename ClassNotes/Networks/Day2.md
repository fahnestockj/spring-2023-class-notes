-   Left starts
-   At the end of a statement says “over”
-   Reciever says Roger if sensible data is recieved



### Data flow types
- simplex -> always headed in one direction - printer
- Half-duplex -> information can head in both directions but can't do both at the same time. One can communicate at a time - bus inside a computer, if at any time more than one persion talks there's interference
- Full-duplex -> can talk and listen at the same time data can head in both directions - phone calls 


### Hub vs Switch
- Hub every input to hub sent to all nodes other than source of the input -> whatever comes in is sent out to all connected nodes, a hub doesn't know how to do routing, only one conversation can happen at a time

- Network Switch -> Inputs to switch sent only to destination node, does routing by sending the data to only the intended recepient

## Network Types
### LAN
- owned and managed by private netity
- in a small physical space
- any **host** has an identifier, an address that uniquely defines the host in the LAN.

### WAN - wide aread network
- generally owned by communication companies
- leased by organizations that use it
-

### MAN - metropolitan area network
- spans size of city -> an example is a cable network



Two type of switched networks
- Circuit switched
- Packet switched
> Packet switched networks can emulate circuit switched


A circuit switched network work through two switches connected by a high capacity line. Each switch then has several low capacity lines connected to devices.


Packet switch Network
Message broken up into smaller pieces called packets
Has a Router which has memory to form a Queue 
- Shared high capacity line with less than worst case cpacity can be used
- switches must have store and forward capability
- Messages can incur delay
- high utilization
